# Custom Component Island with hydration built with native Web Components

The idea of the project is to build my own component island to load static files on SSR and use hydration for interactive components, so mix the SSR and CSR benefits and scratch the logic behind this.

This custom component island should be compatible with other CSR frameworks like React, Vue, etc...
